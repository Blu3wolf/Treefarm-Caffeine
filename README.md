# Treefarm-Caffeine
Adds coffee and tea plants to the otherwise vanilla Factorio!

Adds two new plants, namely coffee and tea to the game. Both can be used to produce caffeine which then can be used to produce "crafting-booster". Using them (like other capsules) increases your crafting speed. However it comes with a twist.

How it works:
If you take one pill your crafting speed is doubled for 60s. If you take another one in that "buff-phase" the timespan in which the effect is applied is increased by another 50%. Another pill increased the timespan by 33%, another by 25% and so on...
After the "buff-phase" there is the "debuff-phase" and here comes the twist. Because consuming that much caffeine can't be healthy, your craftingspeed is descreased (to 50% of the default) for at least 90s. However if you take yet another pill in this phase the timespan for the debuff is decreased by 10%.

Note:
- coffee and especially tea are growing very slowly, so be patient ;)
- seeds can be used similar to "vanilla-treefarm" seeds (auto-farming with fields, placing in the wilderness, etc.)
- you will receive your first seeds after finishing the related research
